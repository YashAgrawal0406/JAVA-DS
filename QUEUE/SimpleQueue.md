## Explanation

> A Queue is an abstract linear data structure serving as a collection of elements that are inserted (enqueue operation) and removed (dequeue operation) according to the First in First Out (FIFO) approach.

> Insertion happens at the rear end of the queue whereas deletion happens at the front end of the queue. The front of the queue is returned using the peek operation.

### Operations
- `Enqueue` : The Enqueue operation is used to add an element to the front of the queue.
- `Dequeue` : The Dequeue operation is used to remove an element from the rear of the queue.
- `Peek` : The Peek operation is used to return the front most element of the queue.
- `isFull` : The isFull operation is used to check if the queue is full or not.
- `isEmpty` : The isEmpty operation is used to check if the queue is empty or not.

### Complexity
- `Enqueue` : O(1)
- `Dequeue` : O(1)
- `Peek` : O(1)
- `isFull` : O(1)
- `isEmpty` : O(1)
